# Nix PostgreSQL + LUKS + mTLS Example

This example demonstrates how to build an Attestable AMI with a LUKS-encrypted PostgreSQL data volume, unlocked via AWS KMS-attested decryption, and secured with mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. The instance boots, measures itself using NitroTPM, decrypts a symmetric key from AWS KMS based on TPM attestation policy, and uses that key to manage a LUKS-encrypted EBS volume and decrypt server TLS certificates. PostgreSQL runs with its data directory on the encrypted volume and requires client certificate verification for all remote connections.

On first boot, the raw EBS volume is automatically LUKS-formatted and an ext4 filesystem is created. On subsequent boots, the volume is simply unlocked and mounted — data persists across instance terminations as long as the same EBS volume and symmetric key are used.

[Full details on the Nix Attestable AMI Builder](../../README.md)

## Architecture / Decrypt Flow

The following sequence describes the boot-time data flow from encrypted symmetric key through to a running PostgreSQL instance with mTLS:

1. **Instance boots** — NitroTPM measures the Unified Kernel Image (UKI) into PCR registers (PCR4 for the UKI, PCR7 for secure boot if enabled).
2. **`kms-init.service` starts** after `network-online.target` is reached.
3. **Fetches IMDSv2 token** and reads EC2 user data containing the KMS `key_id`, the base64-encoded encrypted `ciphertext`, and the encrypted `server_cert_bundle`.
4. **Checks `key_id` against the KMS key ARN pinned into the image** and refuses to continue on any mismatch — user data is not measured into any PCR, so it cannot be trusted to name the key (see [KMS key pinning](#kms-key-pinning)).
5. **Calls `nitro-tpm-kms-decrypt`** with the *pinned* ARN, which presents the TPM attestation document (including PCR measurements) to AWS KMS.
6. **KMS validates PCR measurements** against the key policy conditions. If the measurements match the golden reference, KMS decrypts the ciphertext.
7. **Decrypted symmetric key** is written to `/run/kms-init/symmetric_key` (tmpfs, mode 0750, kms-init group).
8. **`luks-unlock.service` starts** and reads the symmetric key.
9. **LUKS volume management:**
   - *First boot:* `cryptsetup luksFormat` + `luksOpen` + `mkfs.ext4` on `/dev/mapper/data`
   - *Subsequent boot:* `cryptsetup luksOpen` only
10. **`cert-init.service` starts** — fetches the encrypted server certificate bundle from user data via IMDS, decrypts it using the symmetric key, and writes the CA cert, server cert, and server key to `/run/postgresql-certs/` with correct ownership and permissions.
11. **`data.mount`** mounts `/dev/mapper/data` to `/data` as ext4.
12. **`postgresql.service` starts** with its data directory at `/data/postgresql`, SSL enabled, and `clientcert=verify-full` enforced for all remote connections.

## KMS key pinning

EC2 user data is **not** measured into any PCR. If `kms-init` took `key_id` from user data on trust, the account operator could launch this genuine, correctly-measured AMI against a KMS key whose policy *they* control, feed it a ciphertext they made, and get an instance that unlocks an attacker-chosen LUKS volume and serves attacker-chosen mTLS certs — while presenting valid PCR4/PCR7 to a third-party verifier. The attestation would be sound; it just never said anything about *which key* was consulted.

So the expected key ARN is a build input. It lives in [`kms-key-arn.txt`](./kms-key-arn.txt), ends up in the measured store closure, and [`kms-verify.sh`](./kms-verify.sh) compares user data against it by exact string equality before any decrypt. Substituting the key now requires editing the image, which changes PCR4, which the key policy refuses to decrypt for.

This makes key provisioning two-phase, because pinning otherwise makes the dependency graph circular — the ARN must be known *before* the build, but the PCR-gated key policy can only be written *after* it:

| Step | Script | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [`02a_create_kms_key.sh`](./scripts/steps/02a_create_kms_key.sh) | Creates the key under a bootstrap policy granting the provisioning principal `kms:PutKeyPolicy` + `kms:Encrypt` + `kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion` — no `Decrypt`, no attestation conditions — and writes the ARN to `kms-key-arn.txt`. |
| 2 | `00_create_ami.sh` | Builds and measures the image, with the ARN inside it. |
| 3 | [`03_create_symmetric_key.sh`](./scripts/steps/03_create_symmetric_key.sh) | Wraps the symmetric key under the pinned key, using the bootstrap `kms:Encrypt` grant — **before** finalize revokes it. |
| 4 | [`02b_finalize_kms_policy.sh`](./scripts/steps/02b_finalize_kms_policy.sh) | Installs the real PCR-gated policy and **revokes `kms:PutKeyPolicy` and `kms:Encrypt` in the same call**, leaving the provisioning principal `kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion` only. |

Step 4 is a one-way ratchet: after it, nobody — including the account admin — can widen the policy or mint a new ciphertext to bypass the NitroTPM conditions. `03_create_symmetric_key.sh` wraps the DEK in step 3, while the bootstrap `kms:Encrypt` grant is still in place; step 4 then revokes `Encrypt` (and `PutKeyPolicy`), so no principal can produce another valid ciphertext afterward. Nothing is exposed before finalize either: the only ciphertext is the deployer's own DEK, and `Decrypt` is gated on the PCRs from the outset.

Three consequences worth knowing before you build:

- **`kms-key-arn.txt` must stay git-tracked.** When the flake ref resolves to `git+file://`, Nix only sees git-tracked paths, so an untracked file is invisible to the build. Edits to an already-tracked file *are* picked up from the dirty worktree, which is what makes the rewrite work. `02a` refuses to create a key if the file is untracked, so you find out before an orphan key exists.
- **An empty file means unpinned.** That keeps a fresh clone and CI buildable without AWS. The resulting image fails closed at boot rather than falling back to trusting user data. `clean.sh` truncates the file back to empty.
- **The AMI is bound to one account, region and key.** A new key means a rebuild, a new PCR4 and a new policy, so `clean.sh` followed by `start.sh` can no longer reuse an image. That is inherent to pinning, not a limitation of this implementation — it turns the AMI from a reusable artifact into a per-deployment build.

**Scope.** Pinning fixes *which key* is consulted, not *which ciphertext*. Because finalize revokes `kms:Encrypt`, no principal can wrap a fresh symmetric key under the pinned key after deployment, so the ciphertext-substitution vector is closed for the standing policy — the only wrap happens during provisioning (step 3), before the ratchet. The deployer necessarily sees that one plaintext DEK, since `05a_create_certificates.sh` needs it; trusting the deployer at provisioning time is inherent. Pinning a KMS *alias* ARN would sidestep the circularity but give up the property: `UpdateAlias` is mutable and would re-point the trust root without touching the image.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions (see [Minimal IAM Privileges](#minimal-iam-privileges) below)
- Nix package manager installed
- `jq` command-line JSON processor
- AWS account with sufficient permissions for EC2, EBS, KMS, IAM, Secrets Manager, and STS operations

## Minimal IAM Privileges

The following IAM permissions are required for the full end-to-end deployment flow. You can scope these to specific resources for tighter security.

The finalized KMS key policy grants the provisioning principal only
`kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion` on the new key (`kms:Encrypt` is used during
provisioning under the bootstrap policy and revoked at finalize). It does not
grant `kms:PutKeyPolicy`, `kms:CreateGrant`, `kms:Encrypt`, or decrypt
permissions, so the attestation condition remains the only path for decrypting
the wrapped symmetric key.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and test the Attestable AMI with PostgreSQL and LUKS encryption:

### 1. Configure AWS Credentials

You can configure AWS credentials using one of the following methods:

**Method A: Using AWS CLI Configure (Recommended)**

Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

```sh
# For default profile
aws configure

# For a specific profile (useful for multiple accounts)
aws configure --profile myprofile
```

This will prompt you for:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Default region name (e.g., `us-east-2`)
- Default output format (e.g., `json`)

More information can be found on the [official documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

**Method B: Export Environment Variables**

Alternatively, you can export the required AWS credentials and default region to your current shell:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<AWS_SESSION_TOKEN>
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2
```

**Using Profiles**

If you configured a specific profile, you can use it by setting the AWS_PROFILE environment variable:

```sh
export AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
```

The `start.sh` script will automatically detect credentials from either environment variables or your AWS configuration.

### 2. Create Test Setup

Run the following script to build the Attestable image and set up the necessary AWS resources:

```sh
./scripts/start.sh
```

This script performs the following actions:

* Creates the KMS key first, under a bootstrap policy, and pins its ARN into `kms-key-arn.txt` so the build measures it (see [KMS key pinning](#kms-key-pinning))
* Builds an image with NixOS containing:
    * [KMS decrypt application](https://github.com/aws/NitroTPM-Tools/blob/main/nitro-tpm-attest/examples/kms_decrypt.rs) for fetching attestation documents and decrypting ciphertexts
    * [Systemd service](./kms-init.nix) to decrypt and store the symmetric key on system boot
    * [LUKS unlock service](./luks-init.nix) to format (first boot) or unlock (subsequent boots) the encrypted EBS volume
    * [Certificate init service](./cert-init.nix) to decrypt the server TLS certificate bundle at boot
    * PostgreSQL service configured with SSL and mTLS (`clientcert=verify-full`) on the encrypted volume
* Creates an AMI from the image using EBS direct API
* Sets up AWS resources including an instance role, the finalized PCR-gated KMS key policy, an encrypted symmetric key, and a blank EBS volume
* Generates a CA and TLS certificates, encrypts the server bundle into user data, and stores the client bundle in AWS Secrets Manager
* Launches an EC2 instance using the new AMI with the EBS volume attached as `/dev/xvdf`. The instance's user data includes the ciphertext of the symmetric key, the KMS key ARN, and the encrypted server certificate bundle.

**User-data format.** The artifacts are passed to the instance as a single JSON object on EC2 user data (read at boot via IMDSv2). All binary values are single-line base64:

```json
{
  "key_id": "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<account>:key/<uuid>",
  "ciphertext": "<base64(KMS-encrypted symmetric key)>",
  "server_cert_bundle": "<base64(AES-256-CBC(tar of ca.crt + server.crt + server.key))>"
}
```

- `key_id` — the **full key ARN**, not a bare key id. `kms-init` compares it against the ARN pinned into the image by exact string equality and refuses to boot on a mismatch, so a bare id fails every boot. `aws kms encrypt --key-id` accepts either form, which is why `03_create_symmetric_key.sh` validates it up front.
- `ciphertext` — the symmetric key, encrypted with KMS; `kms-init` decrypts it only if the instance's PCRs satisfy the KMS key policy.
- `server_cert_bundle` — a tarball of the server certs encrypted with that symmetric key (not KMS), so `cert-init` must run after `kms-init`.

The **client** certs (`ca.crt`, `client.crt`, `client.key`) are not in user data — they are stored separately in AWS Secrets Manager (base64 fields in a JSON secret) and used by the connecting client.

Optional flags:
- `--secure-boot` — sign the UKI for secure boot as a post-build step (ephemeral local keys; PCR7 changes each run)
- `--secure-boot --secrets-manager [ARN]` — persist/reuse a secure boot golden identity in AWS Secrets Manager for reproducible PCR7 (keeps `db.key` off disk)
- `--debug` — build with debug console access and SSM (Systems Manager) remote shell enabled

**Note:** Make sure to copy the public address of the launched instance, as you'll need it for the next step.

### 3. Test PostgreSQL

The instance is launched with a **public IP** and PostgreSQL is accessible over mTLS on port 5432 at that address. The security group only allows the VPC CIDR by default, so `start.sh` prints an **ACTION REQUIRED** notice at the end with the security group ID and your detected public IP. Authorize your host before connecting:

```sh
# Find your public IP:
curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com

# Authorize it on the security group start.sh printed (also in artifacts/resources.json):
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id <SG_ID_FROM_OUTPUT> --protocol tcp --port 5432 \
  --cidr <YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>/32
```

Then retrieve the client certificate bundle from AWS Secrets Manager (the `SECRET_ARN` is stored in `artifacts/resources.json`) and connect with `psql` using the client certificates and the instance's **public IP**:

```sh
# Retrieve client certs from Secrets Manager
SECRET_ARN=$(jq -r '.SECRET_ARN' artifacts/resources.json)
SECRET_JSON=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id "$SECRET_ARN" --query 'SecretString' --output text)
echo "$SECRET_JSON" | jq -r '.ca_cert' | base64 -d > /tmp/ca.crt
echo "$SECRET_JSON" | jq -r '.client_cert' | base64 -d > /tmp/client.crt
echo "$SECRET_JSON" | jq -r '.client_key' | base64 -d > /tmp/client.key
chmod 600 /tmp/client.key

# Connect via mTLS (use the EC2 Public IP from the start.sh summary)
psql "sslmode=verify-ca sslcert=/tmp/client.crt sslkey=/tmp/client.key sslrootcert=/tmp/ca.crt host=<INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP> port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres-client"
```

In debug mode (`--debug`), SSM Session Manager access with local peer authentication is also available. Connect via:

```sh
aws ssm start-session --region <region> --target <INSTANCE_ID>
```

### 4. Clean Up Resources

To remove all created resources, run:

```sh
./scripts/clean.sh
```

## Build Variants

The flake produces two image variants along the operator-access axis (debug vs
production). Secure boot is **not** a separate package — it is applied as a
post-build signing step (see below).

**Debug vs Production** controls operator access:

- Production builds have zero operator access — no console login, no SSH, no SSM agent, no root password. Security assertions are enforced. The only way to interact with the instance is via mTLS to PostgreSQL on port 5432.
- Debug builds enable console auto-login as root, SSM agent for remote shell access, and bypass security assertions. Use for development and troubleshooting only.

| Package | Operator Access | Baseline PCRs |
|---|---|---|
| `raw-image` | None | PCR4 |
| `raw-image-debug` | Console + SSM | PCR4 |

**Secure Boot** controls boot integrity verification and is applied as a
post-build step, not as a distinct image package:

- Without secure boot, the TPM measures the Unified Kernel Image (UKI) into PCR4. Builds are fully reproducible — same source produces identical images with identical PCR4 values.
- With secure boot, the unsigned UKI is signed with the `db` key by the `sign-efi-image` app (run outside the nix derivation, so `db.key` never enters the nix store); the signed UKI is patched into the ESP, the UEFI variable store is built from the PK/KEK/db ESLs, and PCR4 + PCR7 are computed against the signed image. This prevents unauthorized bootloaders from running.

`start.sh --secure-boot` generates an **ephemeral** local key hierarchy for a
one-off signed build; PCR7 changes on every run because the keys (and their
GUID) are freshly generated. For **reproducible** PCR7, add `--secrets-manager`:
the whole secure boot golden identity (fixed GUID + PK/KEK/db certs, plus the
private `db.key`) is persisted as a single JSON secret and reused across
deployments, so both PCR4 and PCR7 stay stable. `sign-efi-image` fetches
`db.key` from the secret in memory (`--identity-arn`), so the private key never
touches the local filesystem. Regenerating the identity is a deliberate PCR7
roll (the AWS revocation model). See the root
[Secure Boot Workflow](../../README.md#secure-boot-workflow) for the shared
build → sign → create-ami sequence.

## First Boot vs Subsequent Boot

This example uses a blank (unformatted) EBS volume that is initialized on-instance at first boot:

- **First boot:** The `luks-unlock.service` detects that `/dev/xvdf` is not LUKS-formatted (via `cryptsetup isLuks`). It runs `cryptsetup luksFormat` to encrypt the volume, `cryptsetup luksOpen` to unlock it, and `mkfs.ext4` to create a filesystem. PostgreSQL then initializes its data directory at `/data/postgresql`.

- **Subsequent boots:** The service detects that `/dev/xvdf` is already LUKS-formatted and simply runs `cryptsetup luksOpen` to unlock it. The existing filesystem and PostgreSQL data directory are preserved.

Data persists across instance terminations as long as:
1. The same EBS volume is reattached to the new instance
2. The same symmetric key (same KMS key and encrypted ciphertext in user data) is used

This design ensures the symmetric key never leaves the attested instance in plaintext — LUKS formatting happens entirely on-instance, not during deployment.

## mTLS Authentication

PostgreSQL is configured with mutual TLS (mTLS) for all remote connections. This means both the server and client must present valid certificates signed by the same CA.

**How it works:**

- At provisioning time, a self-signed CA is generated along with server and client certificates. The server certificate bundle is encrypted with the KMS symmetric key and embedded in the instance's user data. The client certificate bundle is stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
- At boot time, the `cert-init.service` decrypts the server certificate bundle inside the TEE and writes the plaintext certificates to `/run/postgresql-certs/` (tmpfs). The server private key never exists in plaintext outside the TEE.
- PostgreSQL is configured with `hostssl all all 0.0.0.0/0 cert clientcert=verify-full`, requiring all remote clients to present a valid certificate signed by the CA.
- Local unix socket connections continue to use peer authentication, preserving debug-mode SSH access.

**Connecting as a client:**

Clients retrieve their certificate bundle from Secrets Manager and connect using `psql` with the client certificate files. The client certificate has CN=`postgres-client`, which maps to the `postgres-client` PostgreSQL role created automatically on first boot.

This example uses `sslmode=verify-ca`, which validates the server certificate is signed by the trusted CA but does not check hostname matching. This is appropriate when connecting by private IP address within a VPC.

For production deployments where hostname verification is required, use `sslmode=verify-full` and generate the server certificate with a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) matching the hostname or IP clients will connect to. For example, when generating the server cert in `05a_create_certificates.sh`, add a SAN extension:

```sh
# Example: add SAN for a DNS name or IP
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out server.crt -days 825 \
  -extfile <(printf "subjectAltName=DNS:postgres.internal.example.com,IP:10.0.1.50")
```

Then connect with full verification:

```sh
psql "sslmode=verify-full sslcert=/tmp/client.crt sslkey=/tmp/client.key sslrootcert=/tmp/ca.crt host=postgres.internal.example.com port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres-client"
```

## Cleanup

To tear down all AWS resources created by this example, run:

```sh
./scripts/clean.sh
```

This script reads resource IDs from `artifacts/resources.json` and removes: the Secrets Manager secret, EC2 instance, security group, AMI, EBS volume, IAM instance profile and role (including inline policies), and schedules the KMS key for deletion. It continues on individual failures and preserves `resources.json` if any operation fails, so you can re-run it or clean up manually.

## End-to-End Testing

For full lifecycle validation — including mTLS connectivity and data persistence across instance termination — use the end-to-end test script:

```sh
./scripts/e2e-test.sh
```

This script provisions all resources (including certificate generation and Secrets Manager storage), validates PostgreSQL connectivity over mTLS on first boot, writes test data, terminates the instance, launches a new instance with the same EBS volume, verifies the data persists over mTLS, and then cleans up all resources including the Secrets Manager secret and IAM inline policies.

Like `start.sh`, the E2E test launches the instance with a **public IP** so it can validate mTLS from a host outside the VPC — e.g. a laptop or a remote dev box.

> **Prerequisite — allowlist your host on the security group.** The instance's security group only permits inbound 5432 from the VPC CIDR, so your host's public IP must be added before the mTLS checks can connect. The script prints an **ACTION REQUIRED** notice with the security group ID and your detected public IP, then (when run interactively) pauses so you can add the rule:
>
> ```sh
> # Find your public IP:
> curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com
>
> # Authorize it on the security group the script printed:
> aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
>   --group-id <SG_ID_FROM_OUTPUT> --protocol tcp --port 5432 \
>   --cidr <YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>/32
> ```
>
> The script never modifies the security group for host access itself. In non-interactive/CI runs (no TTY) it does not pause — pre-authorize the source range beforehand.

By default, the E2E test runs the **simplest path** (unsigned image, PCR4-only KMS policy) so developers can iterate quickly with minimal prerequisites. For the full production-representative integration, pass `--secure-boot --secrets-manager`:

```sh
# Full integration: secure boot + Secrets Manager golden identity (recommended for CI)
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --secure-boot --secrets-manager
```

Flags:

- `--secure-boot` — sign the UKI for secure boot (ephemeral local keys; PCR7 changes each run)
- `--secure-boot --secrets-manager [ARN]` — sign against a reproducible golden identity in Secrets Manager. With no ARN, the test generates and uploads a fresh identity and deletes it on teardown; with an ARN, it reuses that identity and leaves it in place. Requires `--secure-boot`.
- `--debug` — adds SSM-based checks alongside mTLS
- `--timeout` — validation timeout in seconds (default: 600)
- `--no-cleanup` — skip resource teardown on failure for debugging
- `--admin-role-arn <ARN>` — override the KMS key admin principal
- `--vpc-id <ID>` — launch into a specific VPC (default VPC otherwise)
- `--start-phase <1|2|3>` — resume a prior `--no-cleanup` run at a later phase (2 = first-boot validation, 3 = persistence). Provisioning is skipped and resource IDs are read from `artifacts/resources.json` (the instance's public IP is re-derived from the recorded `INSTANCE_ID`, and the SG-authorization notice is re-printed). Requires that a previous run left `resources.json` in place. Pair with `--no-cleanup` to keep iterating.

Example — a full run failed at Phase 2 and left resources up; retry just the validation without re-provisioning:

```sh
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --no-cleanup            # full run; leaves resources on failure
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --start-phase 2 --no-cleanup   # re-run validation against the same instance
```
